        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Diwali, the festival of lights, is celebrated with great joy and enthusiasm. However, the bursting of fireworks significantly contributes to air pollution, especially in cities. Harmful gases and particles are released into the air, leading to an increase in respiratory issues, eye irritation, and environmental damage.</p>

                <li>PM 2.5 and PM 10 particles increase dramatically, causing respiratory problems.</li>

            <img src="pollutants.jpg">
        <ul>
            <li>Particulate Matter (PM2.5 and PM10): Firecrackers release fine particulate matter,
             which can penetrate deep into the lungs and cause respiratory issues.</li>
            <li>Sulfur Dioxide (SO₂) It can cause respiratory problems, particularly for people with asthma or other lung conditions.</li>
            <li>Nitrogen Oxides (NOₓ): Fireworks release nitrogen oxides,
                which contribute to the formation of ground-level ozone and smog, further deteriorating air quality</li>
            <li>Heavy Metals: Fireworks contain metals like lead, mercury, cadmium, and barium, which are released into the air during combustion</li>

        <h2>How to Prevent Air Pollution during Diwali</h2>
        <p>To reduce air pollution and celebrate an eco-friendly Diwali, we can adopt the following practices:</p>
        <div id="prevent-container">
            <img src="prevent.jpg">
        <ul>
            <li>Use eco-friendly fireworks that cause less pollution.</li>
            <li>Limit the bursting of firecrackers, especially in densely populated areas.</li>
            <li>Celebrate with earthen lamps (diyas) and LED lights instead of crackers.</li>
            <li>Organize community fireworks to reduce individual celebrations.</li>
            <li>Encourage the use of flower petals and natural materials for rangolis instead of chemical-based colors.</li>
            <li>Spread awareness about the harmful effects of firecrackers.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    
    <section id="causes">
        <h2>Causes of Air Pollution During Diwali</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Firecrackers: The most significant contributor to air pollution during Diwali is the extensive use of firecrackers, 
    which release harmful pollutants like sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter into the atmosphere.</li>
    
    <li>Burning of Waste: People often burn waste materials to clear up spaces for festivities, releasing smoke 
        and toxins into the air</li>
    <li>Vehicle Emissions: Increased traffic during the festival can lead to higher emissions from vehicles, 
        contributing to poor air quality.</li>
    <li>Construction Activities: Ongoing construction projects can also contribute to dust and particulate matter in the air, 
        exacerbated by increased activity during the festival.
    </li>
    <li> Meteorological Conditions: During Diwali, weather conditions like temperature inversion can trap pollutants close 
        to the ground, worsening air quality.</li>
   
    </ul>
